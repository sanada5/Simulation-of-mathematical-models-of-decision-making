This repository contains the simulations of three main mathematical models of decision making, developed in the papers “Decision with multiple alternatives: Geometric
models in higher dimensions — the cube model” and "Decision with multiple alternatives: Geometric models in higher dimensions — the disk model" by K. Mallahi-Karai and A. Diederich, as part of my bachelor thesis and work as a Research Assistant at my alma mater, Jacobs University (now known as Constructor University).
