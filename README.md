This repository contains the simulations of three main mathematical models of decision making, developed in the papers “Decision with multiple alternatives: Geometric
models in higher dimensions — the cube model” and "Decision with multiple alternatives: Geometric models in higher dimensions — the disk model" by K. Mallahi-Karai and A. Diederich, as part of my bachelor thesis and work as  Research Assistant at my alma mater, Jacobs University (now known as Constructor University). 


In particular, I simulate Cube model in the setting with three alternatives, two alternatives and the fall-back option as well as the Disk model. The main objective of my work was to detect the influence of the model parameters in the choice probabilities of the available options, stop-ping time (reaction time distribution) and episode durations. Lastly, I investigate, through the simulations, a new research direction in this field such as the Worst-best option ranking.
